A project for a Year 9 IT Class

Dont clone this, the images in lib are out of date. I'll have to update them.
In the mean time, don't open any user profiles, unless you want to see a messed up tkinter window with a out of proportion default image

On a side note, the images (in .pgm format) should be around 180x180

Edit: This was when I was first learning to program, so much of the code is quite bad. It follows no sensible style guide and I didn't realise that tkinter button callbacks were able to use lambdas (more like I had no idea how to use lambdas). Anyways please don't judge this small project. The file labled --all should work, don't use the other one.

Edit 2: If this somehow manages to get into the Github backup thing, I'm sorry you had to witness this.

## Archiving this as it's pretty bad code, but I'd like to keep it as a memory
